# README

These are my scripts to setup a new Mac.

```
git clone https://github.com/wgoolsby/dot-files.git && cd dot-files

sudo sh setup_scripts/new.sh arg
```
You can run the script with the following arguments
* all - runs every script in setup_scripts
* brew - runs only the brew.sh script
* macOS - runs only the macOS.sh script
* web - runs only the web.sh script
* zsh - runs only the zsh.sh script
* mas - runs only the mas.sh script

The process is full automated, but watch for password requests.
